;;;; projectwarrior.lisp

;;; This program walked a user through a review of their projects.
;;; Projects are pulled from the task management program `taskwarrior`.
;;; Each project is presented, one by one, and the user is asked to classify
;;; the project as either (a)ctive, (c)ompleted, or (d)eleted.
;;;
;;; Active projects are entered into the projects list for the next review.
;;; Completed and deleted projects are removed from the projects list.
;;;
;;; Future versions will do something different with completed and deleted
;;; projects, but for now the two behave identically.
;;;
;;; Greet user
;;; Sync projects list
;;; Display project
;;; Sort project (keep or delete)
;;; When finished, say goodbye.

This way, the user can say things like 'project 4 done' instead of 'project done 4' so I can align
more closely to the taskwarrior interface style. The basic interface style is
project <filter string> <add|done|delete|modify|view> <project data (optional)>
So the command dispatcher should interpret all strings found before the first instance of a
command keyword as a filter and then filter the appropriate lists. It should then interpret the
command keyword as a funciton to call and pass anything after the keyword as arguments to apply to
the project(s) being modified."
